# Resources-for-STEM-students
This is meant to be a repository open for collaboration for STEM students, sharing of scripts, code, notes and anything helpfull to battle long hours at the library.

Please make sure all work published is valig, clean, well structured and documented.

i initially made this repo to share some of my scripts with my fellow students, since i've had the idea to make it a large public repo, to allow others to contribute, share and use the collective resources for all interested in anything STEM.
